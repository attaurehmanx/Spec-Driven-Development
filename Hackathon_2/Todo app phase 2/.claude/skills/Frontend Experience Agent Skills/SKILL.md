Frontend Experience Agent Skills
UI Component Design (ChatKit/React): Building the Chat Interface, including message bubbles, input areas, and typing indicators.

State Management: Handling the complexity of "optimistic updates" (showing the message immediately) and "server synchronization" (refreshing the Task list when the Agent makes a change).

API Consumption: Writing robust fetch functions to send messages to the backend and handle streamed or JSON responses.
