# Constitution Update for Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

## Prompt Text

```
## Project Identity
This project is a **Todo In-Memory Python Console Application** built using **Spec-Kit Plus** and implemented exclusively via **Claude Code** using a **spec-driven, agentic development workflow**.

## Core Rules
1. **No Manual Coding**
   All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. Humans may only:
   - Write or refine specs
   - Review outputs
   - Request revisions

2. **Scope Control**
   - The application is **console-based only**
   - Data must be stored **in memory only**
   - No databases, files, APIs, or external persistence

3. **Feature Completeness**
   The application must implement **all 5 basic features**:
   - Add Todo
   - View Todos
   - Update Todo
   - Delete Todo
   - Mark Todo as Complete / Incomplete

4. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow clean code principles
   - Use clear naming
   - Modular structure
   - Single responsibility per function
   - Readable console output

5. **Technology Constraints**
   - Python **3.13+**
   - Dependency management via **UV**
   - Compatible with **Spec-Kit Plus**
   - No third-party libraries unless explicitly approved in spec

## Success Criteria
A working console application that demonstrates all required features and adheres to the agentic development workflow without deviation.
```

## Response Text

Updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with all required principles and constraints for the Todo In-Memory Python Console Application. The new constitution establishes 6 core principles and defines the development workflow, technology requirements, and governance structure.

## Outcome

Successfully created and validated the project constitution that reflects all specified requirements and constraints for the Todo application project.

## Evaluation

The constitution update was completed successfully with all placeholder tokens replaced with concrete values based on the provided project specifications.
