# Todo In-Memory Python Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### No Manual Coding
All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. Humans may only write or refine specs, review outputs, and request revisions.

### Scope Control
The application is console-based only with data stored in memory only. No databases, files, APIs, or external persistence allowed.

### Feature Completeness
The application must implement all 5 basic features: Add Todo, View Todos, Update Todo, Delete Todo, Mark Todo as Complete/Incomplete.

### Code Quality Standards
Follow clean code principles with clear naming, modular structure, single responsibility per function, and readable console output.

### Technology Constraints
Use Python 3.13+, dependency management via UV, compatible with Spec-Kit Plus, and no third-party libraries unless explicitly approved in spec.

### Spec-Driven Development
Implementation exclusively via Claude Code using a spec-driven, agentic development workflow without deviation.

## Technology Requirements

Python 3.13+, UV for dependency management, compatible with Spec-Kit Plus, console-based interface only, in-memory storage only.

## Development Workflow

Spec-driven approach where Claude Code generates all implementation based on written specifications. Human involvement limited to spec writing, reviewing, and requesting revisions.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All development must follow agentic workflow without manual coding.
