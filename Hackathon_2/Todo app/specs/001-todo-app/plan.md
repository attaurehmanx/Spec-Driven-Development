# Implementation Plan: Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: [specs/001-todo-app/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Todo In-Memory Python Console Application that allows users to manage tasks through a command-line interface. The application will provide 5 core CRUD-style operations (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete/Incomplete) with in-memory storage only. The system will follow a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: None required beyond standard library (as required by constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory only using Python data structures (as required by constitution)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project - console application
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for all operations
**Constraints**: Console-based only, in-memory storage, no external dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application with reasonable memory limits

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ No Manual Coding: All implementation will be generated by Claude Code
- ✅ Scope Control: Console-based only with in-memory storage only (no databases, files, APIs)
- ✅ Feature Completeness: Will implement all 5 required features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete/Incomplete)
- ✅ Code Quality Standards: Will follow clean code principles with clear naming and modular structure
- ✅ Technology Constraints: Will use Python 3.13+ with UV for dependency management, no third-party libraries
- ✅ Spec-Driven Development: Implementation will follow agentic workflow without manual coding

**Structure Decision**: Single project with layered architecture separating models, services, and CLI interface. Storage layer handles in-memory persistence. Tests organized by type (unit, integration, contract) and by module.
