# Chapter 2 Diagrams - Unity for Human-Robot Interaction

This directory contains diagrams for Chapter 2: Unity for Human-Robot Interaction and Rendering.

## Diagram List

1. **unity_ros_integration.png** - Shows the integration architecture between Unity and ROS 2
2. **hri_environment_design.png** - Illustrates the design principles for HRI environments
3. **robot_visualization_pipeline.png** - Shows the visualization pipeline from ROS to Unity
4. **safety_zone_concepts.png** - Demonstrates safety zones and interaction areas in HRI

## Diagram Descriptions

### 1. Unity-ROS Integration
This diagram shows the architecture of Unity-ROS integration including:
- ROS-TCP-Connector communication layer
- Message publishers and subscribers
- Transform synchronization
- Real-time visualization pipeline

### 2. HRI Environment Design
Illustrates key concepts in Human-Robot Interaction environment design:
- Personal space considerations
- Navigation paths
- Interaction zones
- Safety boundaries
- Visual communication elements

### 3. Robot Visualization Pipeline
Shows the complete pipeline from ROS robot state to Unity visualization:
- Joint state publishing in ROS
- Network communication
- Unity joint control
- Real-time rendering

### 4. Safety Zone Concepts
Demonstrates different types of safety zones in HRI:
- Robot safety radius
- Human safety zones
- Collision detection areas
- Emergency stop zones

## Creation Notes

These diagrams were created to maintain consistency with Module 1's visual style while introducing Unity and HRI-specific concepts. The diagrams use the same color schemes and visual hierarchy as established in the previous module, with additional emphasis on safety and interaction design principles.
