## Diagram Descriptions

### 1. Gazebo Physics Workflow
This diagram shows the complete workflow from robot model definition to physics simulation in Gazebo, including:
- Model definition (SDF/URDF)
- Physics engine integration
- Collision detection
- Force application
- Motion simulation

### 2. Robot Model Structure
Illustrates how robot models are structured with:
- Links (rigid bodies with mass and inertia)
- Joints (connections with constraints)
- Collision geometry
- Visual geometry

### 3. Physics Environment Types
Shows different types of physics environments:
- Flat ground environments
- Complex terrain with obstacles
- Multi-level environments
- Dynamic environments

### 4. Collision vs Visual Geometry
Demonstrates the difference between collision geometry (used for physics simulation) and visual geometry (used for rendering), showing how they can be different but related.

## Creation Notes

These diagrams were created to maintain consistency with Module 1's visual style while introducing Gazebo-specific concepts. The diagrams use the same color schemes and visual hierarchy as established in the previous module.
