# PHR: tasks-gazebo-unity-digital-twin

## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response

Generated comprehensive task list for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) with:
- 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 User Stories plus Polish phase
- 43 specific tasks with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths
- Clear organization by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Parallel execution opportunities identified with [P] markers
- Dependencies and execution order clearly defined
- MVP strategy focusing on User Story 1 as minimum viable product
- Tasks follow the required checklist format with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels

The tasks are organized in phases:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 6 tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 5 tasks for blocking prerequisites
- Phase 3 (US1 - Gazebo Physics): 8 tasks for physics simulation fundamentals
- Phase 4 (US2 - Unity HRI): 8 tasks for Unity integration and visualization
- Phase 5 (US3 - Sensor Simulation): 9 tasks for sensor simulation and ROS 2 integration
- Phase 6 (Polish): 7 tasks for cross-cutting concerns and validation

Each task follows the required format with proper file paths and clear action items.

## Outcome

Task list created successfully and ready for implementation phase (/sp.implement).

## Evaluation

The task list meets all requirements with proper organization by user story, clear dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and adherence to the required format. Tasks are specific enough for implementation while maintaining independence between user stories.
