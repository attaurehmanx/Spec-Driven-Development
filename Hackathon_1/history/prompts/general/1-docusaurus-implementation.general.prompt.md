# Prompt History Record

## User Input

```
The Docusaurus project is already initialized in the `Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics` folder.
For each generated task, complete it fully.
After completing any individual task, automatically update the `task.md` file by marking that specific task as completed using a ✓ (check mark).

Guidelines:
- Do NOT overwrite the entire task list; only update the status of the completed task.
- Ensure the update is appended or modified consistently within `task.md`.
- Maintain the structure and numbering of the task list.
- Each implementation step should reflect actual project changes in the folder.
```
